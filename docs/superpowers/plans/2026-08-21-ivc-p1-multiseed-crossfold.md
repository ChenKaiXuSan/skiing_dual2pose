# IVC P1 Multi-Seed Cross-Fold Implementation Plan

**Status:** Retired from the current IVC submission scope on 2026-09-13. Two fold-1/seed-13 launch-smoke logs are retained; neither entered training, and the six full training cells were not launched.

## Scope decision

The proposed matrix was two legacy action folds times seeds 13, 42, and 73, giving six independent 100-epoch CanonFuse3D trainings. Its purpose was to estimate training-run and fold sensitivity; it was not a new baseline, corruption condition, or external-method comparison.

The current manuscript instead uses the predeclared dataset-specific checkpoints and explicitly describes the added learned comparisons as single-run results. On 2026-09-13 the author confirmed that the six-cell matrix is outside the current submission scope. It is therefore retired rather than failed or partially reported. No smoke value is eligible for the manuscript, and no mean, standard deviation, confidence interval, or cross-fold claim is made from this plan.

Existing launch-smoke logs are preserved at `logs/ivc_p1/multiseed_smoke/` and `logs/ivc_p1/multiseed_smoke_retry/`. Both stop during data loading on the same first fold-1 sample because the required SAM3D frame files are unavailable; neither log contains a training epoch, checkpoint, or result. The unchecked implementation steps below are retained as historical design documentation only and must not be read as pending submission work.

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Run six controlled native-SAM3D trainings across seeds 13/42/73 and the two real legacy action folds, then report training-run uncertainty.

**Architecture:** Training configuration becomes seed- and fold-explicit. A matrix runner creates isolated log directories and status records without overwriting runs. A separate summarizer verifies every checkpoint and test artifact before computing run-level and action-level statistics.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, Hydra/OmegaConf, CSV/JSON, unittest.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-ivc-p1-multiseed-crossfold-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- Use only `fold_00.json` and `fold_01.json`; call the result a two-fold repeated experiment.
- Train seeds 13, 42, and 73 from scratch for 100 epochs.
- Use GPU 0/1 only when each device is free at launch; never kill or preempt an unrelated process.
- Select best validation MPJPE and retain `last.ckpt`.
- Write only under `logs/ivc_p1/multiseed/`.

### Task 1: Seed/fold-explicit training configuration

**Files:**
- Modify: `configs/dual2pose.yaml`
- Modify: `dual2pose/train_unity.py`
- Test: `tests/test_train_unity_matrix_config.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Adds: `train.seed: int = 42`.
- Adds: `resolve_fold_index_path(data_root: Path, fold: int) -> Path`.
- Adds: `validate_fold_metadata(index_path: Path, fold: int) -> None`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write tests proving the hard-coded seed and fixed fold path are removed**

```python
def test_fold_one_resolves_fold_01():
    assert resolve_fold_index_path(Path("/data"), 1).name == "fold_01.json"

def test_metadata_fold_mismatch_fails(tmp_path):
    path = write_fold(tmp_path, metadata_fold=0)
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="metadata fold 0"):
        validate_fold_metadata(path, fold=1)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the focused test and verify failure**

Run: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_train_unity_matrix_config -v`

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement seed/fold resolution and provenance logging**

`train_unity.py` must call `seed_everything(int(config.train.seed), workers=True)` and set the index mapping from `train.fold` before constructing `UnityDataModule`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Make validation and test loaders complete**

Modify `UnityDataModule.val_dataloader()` and `test_dataloader()` to use `drop_last=False`; keep training `drop_last=True`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run focused and existing loader tests**

Run: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_train_unity_matrix_config tests.test_ivc_extension_experiments -v`

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit configuration changes**

```bash
git add configs/dual2pose.yaml dual2pose/train_unity.py \
  dual2pose/dataloader/data_loader.py tests/test_train_unity_matrix_config.py
git commit -m "feat: make Unity training seed and fold explicit"
```

### Task 2: Non-overwriting training matrix runner

**Files:**
- Create: `dual2pose/experiments/run_multiseed_crossfold.py`
- Test: `tests/test_multiseed_runner.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `RunKey(fold: int, seed: int)` and `RunRecord(status, command, log_dir, pid, started_at, completed_at, return_code)`.
- Produces: `build_training_command(run: RunKey, gpu: int, repo_root: Path) -> list[str]`.
- Writes: `logs/ivc_p1/multiseed/run_manifest.json` atomically.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write tests for the exact six-cell matrix and command overrides**

```python
def test_matrix_is_three_seeds_by_two_folds():
    assert set(build_run_matrix()) == {
        RunKey(0, 13), RunKey(0, 42), RunKey(0, 73),
        RunKey(1, 13), RunKey(1, 42), RunKey(1, 73)}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement atomic state transitions and overwrite refusal**

Valid transitions are `pending -> running -> complete|failed`. A directory with a complete record is skipped; a directory with files but no valid record causes a hard error.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement two-GPU scheduling**

Maintain at most one child process per allocated GPU. Poll process status every 30 seconds, append metric-file heartbeat information to the manifest, and start the next pending run when that GPU becomes free. Do not retry a failed run automatically.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run runner tests with fake subprocesses**

Run: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_multiseed_runner -v`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit the runner**

```bash
git add dual2pose/experiments/run_multiseed_crossfold.py tests/test_multiseed_runner.py
git commit -m "feat: schedule multi-seed cross-fold training"
```

### Task 3: Per-run evaluation and statistical summarizer

**Files:**
- Create: `dual2pose/eval/summarize_multiseed_crossfold.py`
- Test: `tests/test_multiseed_summary.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `collect_run_metrics(root: Path) -> list[RunMetrics]`.
- Produces: `summarize_training_runs(rows: Sequence[RunMetrics]) -> dict[str, Any]`.
- Writes the declared per-run, per-action, JSON, and TeX outputs.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write fixture tests for duplicate/missing cells and literal mean/std/t-interval values**
- [ ] **Step 2: Implement checkpoint hash, best-epoch, split, and sample-count validation**
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement descriptive run-level and action-level statistics**

Use sample standard deviation with `ddof=1`. Compute the 95% t-interval with five degrees of freedom for the six-run aggregate. Do not compute a frame-level p-value.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run summary tests**

Run: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_multiseed_summary -v`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit the summarizer**

```bash
git add dual2pose/eval/summarize_multiseed_crossfold.py tests/test_multiseed_summary.py
git commit -m "feat: summarize repeated CanonFuse3D training"
```

### Task 4: Launch, monitor, and aggregate six runs

**Files:**
- Runtime output only: `logs/ivc_p1/multiseed/`

- [ ] **Step 1: Run a one-epoch fold-1/seed-13 smoke training on GPU 0**

Run: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 dual2pose/train_unity.py train.gpu=0 train.fold=1 train.seed=13 train.max_epochs=1 data.num_workers=0 data.batch_size=64 log_path=logs/ivc_p1/multiseed_smoke/fold_1/seed_13`

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify smoke checkpoint metadata and complete validation/test batches**
- [ ] **Step 3: Recheck both GPUs and launch the non-overwriting matrix runner**

Run: `python3 -m dual2pose.experiments.run_multiseed_crossfold --gpus 0 1`

- [ ] **Step 4: Monitor manifest and metric heartbeats until terminal status**
- [ ] **Step 5: Run the summarizer after all six cells are complete**

Run: `python3 -m dual2pose.eval.summarize_multiseed_crossfold --root logs/ivc_p1/multiseed`

- [ ] **Step 6: Verify the six-run matrix and output hashes**
